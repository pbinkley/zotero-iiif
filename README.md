Exploration of how to add IIIF capabilities to Zotero


This exploration was prompted by discussion of various integration by the IIIF community at the [2022 Online Meeting](https://iiif.io/event/2022/online-meeting/). I thought there might be a doable project to create a Zotero plugin that would capture IIIF manifest URIs, store them in captured Zotero records, and make it easy to call them up them in a IIIF viewer. I posted about this on the [Zotero Forum](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/101597/iiif-plugin-proposal?new=1). I'll use this repo for anything shareable that comes out of this exploration.
